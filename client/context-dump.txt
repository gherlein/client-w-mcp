write a program that generates a basic html page

[Assistant] (207 tokens):
Certainly! Below is a simple program written in Go that generates a basic HTML page:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	html := `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Basic HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page generated by Go.</p>
</body>
</html>
`

	fmt.Println(html)
}
```

To run this program, save it to a file with a `.go` extension (e.g., `main.go`) and then execute it using the Go command:

```sh
go run main.go
```

This will print the HTML content to the console. If you want to save it as an actual HTML file, you can modify the program to write the HTML string to a file instead of printing it to the console.

edit that program to also show an image photo.jpg

[Assistant] (439 tokens):
Sure! Below is the modified Go program that generates a basic HTML page with an image included:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	html := `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic HTML Page with Image</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Basic HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page generated by Go.</p>
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</body>
</html>
`

	fmt.Println(html)
}
```

To run this program, save it to a file with a `.go` extension (e.g., `main.go`). Ensure that you have an image named `photo.jpg` in the same directory as your Go program. Then, execute it using the Go command:

```sh
go run main.go
```

This will print the HTML content to the console. If you want to save it as an actual HTML file, you can modify the program to write the HTML string to a file instead of printing it to the console.

Here's how you can write it to a file:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	html := `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic HTML Page with Image</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Basic HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page generated by Go.</p>
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</body>
</html>
`

	err := os.WriteFile("index.html", []byte(html), 0644)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error writing file:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("HTML file has been created successfully.")
}
```

This version of the program writes the HTML content to a file named `index.html`.

edit that program to also include a form that has a name and age field, that posts those fields to a web handler at www.herlein.com/webhandler
